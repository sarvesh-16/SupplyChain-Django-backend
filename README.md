# Agri-Chain
The current agricultural supply chain is a centralized
system that has many issues related to integrity,
organizing the transactions. There is lack of trust and
transparency in the supply chain. There are many
irregularities in the implementation of schemes. The
consumers doubt the quality of the food supplied to them.
The farmers, wholesalers are affected from the payment
frauds by the middlemen. Blockchain helps us solve these
issues by keeping track of all the different stages of food.
The public blockchain being transparent, open, immutable,
trackable helps in reducing the irregularities, frauds. This
paper proposes the agricultural supply chain system model
that uses the Ethereum platform. The smart contracts are
developed for different stages of the supply chain. These
contracts ensure that all the pre-decided conditions are
satisfied before proceeding with the transactions. This
system ensures security, reliability, trust, openness. It eases
the transactions, administrative processes. It gives a fair
chance to farmers to quote a price using smart contracts.
